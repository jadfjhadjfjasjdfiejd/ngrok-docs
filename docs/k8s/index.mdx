# Kubernetes Operator

## Overview

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is the best way to use ngrok if your
applications run in Kubernetes environments. It supports both [Ingress CRDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) as well as the new [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

The ngrok Kubernetes Operator is deployed to a cluster and allows developers to self-service public endpoints to their apps and services using a shared ngrok account.

## When Should I Use The Kubernetes Operator?

The Kubernetes Operator is a great tool to use when you want to use ngrok to connect to services running on a Kubernetes Cluster. If you are running Kubernetes and do not want to use the ngrok SDKs, we recommend using the Operator

## Should I Use The Ingress Controller Or The Gateway API?

The Operator supports both Kubernetes Ingress and the Gateway API. These two different solutions have differences and similarities.

### What Is The Same?

- Both can route traffic to Kubernetes services
- Both can take advantage of ngrok's capabilities, including policies, global points of presence, and resiliency

### What Is Different?

| Simple, easier to set up                                               | More complex to set up                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Expansive permissions required to set Ingress Objects                  | Separation of roles for setting up Gateways (Cluster Operators) and Routes (Application Developers)                                                                                                             |
| Customizations (such as policies) can only be applied with annotations | More expressive spec that enables embedding customizationsin in the Gateway API objects directly. Built in support for features like header modification or redirection and extension points for customizations |

## Pricing

The ngrok Kubernetes Ingress Controller is available to all ngrok users at no
additional charge. You only incur costs if the resources provisioned by the
controller incur a cost.
